## What Are Ultrasonic Sensors? 
Ultrasonic senosrs are sensors that send out sounds at a frquency that cannot be heard to human ears.
Who discovered it?
What is it used in? (teslas)
Why is it useful?

<br>

## What Pins Are On The Sensor?
Echo, Trig, VCC, GND

<br>

## What Data Does The Sensor Show?
Show the time that it takes for one cycle of bouncing sound.
